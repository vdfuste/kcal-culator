# KCal-culator
An online calories counter based on the ingredients previously selected developed with Next.js.

Check it out [here](https://kcal-culator.vercel.app).

There's only four selectable ingredients and I'm not so sure how accurate are the nutritional values, but in a near future I'd to find a proper database to populate the list of ingredients.
